## Description

J.A.T.E. might be just another text editor; however, by utilizing the power of Progressive Web Apps, J.A.T.E. goes from a one-trick pony to a worthwhile and flexible hybrid. J.A.T.E. was built using Webpack, Workbox and Express. As a PWA, it can be downloaded onto a device through a web browser and function like a platform-specific app, as well as work offline. While online, changes made in downloaded app will be shown in deployed URL after refresh and vice versa. J.A.T.E. also features JavaScript syntax highlighting. Visit the link above to get started!
